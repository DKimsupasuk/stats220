# stats220

## This is my repo for **STATS 220**. 

### A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in *Computer Science*.
1. I am taking **STATS 220** because looked like I could learn some interesting stuff and it is linked with *Computer Science* which means it is related to what I'm interested in.
2. I am interested in learning about how to scrape data and how this data can be used/visualised.
