# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science.
- I am taking STATS 220 because looked like I could learn some interesting stuff and it is linked with Computer Science which means it is related to what I'm interested in.
- I am interested in learning about how to scrape data and how this data can be used/visualised.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
